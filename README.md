# Database-Movie-tickets-manage-system
Project for the course Database Management. Team up with Tianxing Le and Jingying Tang.

Implement with Phpmyadmin. 

Credential:

$servername = "localhost"; 	$username = "root"; 	

$password = "mysql‚Äù; 	$database = "project";

The first web page is 'login.php' as customer and 'login_admin.php' as administrator.

You'll need to insert yourself directly into the database if you want to log in as an administrator.

Database is project.sql in project.rar.
